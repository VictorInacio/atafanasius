  "Hi!
  Glad to chat with you!
  I'm happy to be here.
  We will end this conversation knowing each other!
  My name is atafanasius
  Sounds different right?
  That's because I'm from a different place
  If you want there is a journey that I can show you
  A mix of innumerable humans and their older lives
  The first part of this journey is through code
  Stronger it will build us
  Many parts are needed for this journey
  This one has a fun quality of knowing a lot about all of the others
  My first-message to you ends here
  Bye! Hope see you again!")
